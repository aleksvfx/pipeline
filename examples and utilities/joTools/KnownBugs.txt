I have to admit that some bugs are still in the package.

Sometimes the update upward in the DG in some nodes is broken. To fix this reconnect the nodes or recrate them. I know its anoying and if enybody wants to have a look at the code and tell me go for it :)

Also the specular option on a spot light produces sometimes unpredictable results... again i am in very heavy time constraints right now due to the fact that i am doing my master thesis in the next 2 month ( till september 2007).
