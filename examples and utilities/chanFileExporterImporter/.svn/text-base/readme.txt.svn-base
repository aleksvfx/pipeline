Version: .5b

Description:
This is my first Python plug-in that I've decided to release, just place within your maya plug-ins directory and load using the standard maya plug-in manager. To export chan file just select either Export all or Export Selected from the file menu with the desired items selected.
    
If you find any bugs please contact me and I'll get to fixing them as soon
as possible.

A tutorial for this is available online at

    Enjoy!
